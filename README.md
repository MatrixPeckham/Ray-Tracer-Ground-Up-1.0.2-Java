# Ray-Tracer-Ground-Up-Java
Ray tracer program, originally a java port of Ray Tracing from the Ground Up books skeleton tracer

I will be adding all the features in the book. There's a branch for the initial skeleton, a branch for the
ray tracer that the book has in the third chapter. The master branch is currently for the fully featured ray tracer that has
all the features that the book describes.  

Currently the master branch supports all book features, and can render all build functions provided in the book's website chapter downloads. 

After I finish Updating the documentation master will be branched again into a "feature-complete" branch. The master branch will become the branch for new functions from exersizes or other soucres.
