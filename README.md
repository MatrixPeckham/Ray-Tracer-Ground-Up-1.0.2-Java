# Ray-Tracer-Ground-Up-Java
Ray tracer program, originally a java port of Ray Tracing from the Ground Up books skeleton tracer

I will be adding all the features in the book. There's a branch for the initial skeleton, a branch for the
ray tracer that the book has in the third chapter. The master branch is for the fully featured ray tracer that has
all the features that the book describes.  

At presant it does not fully support all the code available from the books website. I've got a long way to go.
